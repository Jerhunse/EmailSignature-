# Email Signature

This project contains a single, modern, Gmail-optimized HTML email signature for The Lex Group.

## Files Included

- `email-signature-gmail-embedded.html` — The main HTML signature file, ready for use in Gmail. All icons are embedded as base64, and logos are hosted on Google Drive for maximum compatibility.
- `The Lex Group-min.png` — The optimized logo image used in the signature (hosted on Google Drive, not needed for signature installation).
- `README.md` — This documentation file.
