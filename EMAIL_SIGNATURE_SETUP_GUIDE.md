1. Upload `alexis.jpg` to your website (e.g., `https://www.thelexgrp.com/images/alexis.jpg`)
2. Replace `alexis.jpg` in the signature code with the full URL
3. This ensures the image works in all email clients

**Option 2: Use Cloud Storage**
1. Upload `alexis.jpg` to Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive
2. Get the sharing link
3. Replace the image source in the signature code

**Option 3: Keep Local File (Limited)**
- Only works if the HTML file and image are in the same folder
- May not work in all email clients

### **For the eXp Logo:**
- Same process as above - upload to your website and update the URL

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Images Don't Show:**
- Upload images to your website and use full URLs
- Check that your email client allows images
- Try refreshing the email

### **If Icons Don't Display:**
- The icons are embedded SVG, so they should work everywhere
- Try a different email client if issues persist

### **If Links Don't Work:**
- Verify all URLs are correct in the signature code
- Test each link by clicking on it
